# Blog frontend (fullstack course part 5)

FINISHED PART 5 FRONTEND. Note, the E2E testing section of part 5 is instead here: https://github.com/kwantton/FS-blog-E2E-part-5/tree/main
So, now E2E testing is no longer here.

OLDER:
"SO - I git cloned this from https://github.com/kwantton/FS-blog-app-frontend, removed .git, and added .gitignore (have not made a new repo yet).
THIS IS THE VERSION 5.3 that was found slightly incompatible with my backend since there was trouble with the userId and .blog schema back then
(trouble started at 5.3). But other than that, this now works. We'll see if this goes together with the backend that I copy-pasted from
part 4's model answers (at https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/stats/courses/fullstackopen/solutions/4)."
