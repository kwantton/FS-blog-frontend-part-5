# Blog frontend (fullstack course part 4)

SO - I git cloned this from https://github.com/kwantton/FS-blog-app-frontend, removed .git, and added .gitignore (have not made a new repo yet).
THIS IS THE VERSION 5.3 that was found slightly incompatible with my backend since there was trouble with the userId and .blog schema back then
(trouble started at 5.3). But other than that, this should be ok? We'll see if this goes together with the backend that I copy-pasted from
part 4's model answers (at https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/stats/courses/fullstackopen/solutions/4).
